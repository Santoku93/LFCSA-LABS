1. Using any method you choose, create a directory in your home directory called "attributes". Once created, change to that directory.

ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION:

[user@linuxacademy:~] $ mkdir attributes && cd attributes

 

2. Create three files in this directory called "test1", "test2" and "test3". The contents of the files can be anything you choose.

SOLUTION POSSIBILITIES:

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ touch test1 test2 test3

OR

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ echo "Some text" > test1 (repeating for test2 and test3)

 

 3. Using the appropriate octal or ascii permission notation (your choice), permissions should be read, write, execute for the owner and read, execute for everyone else. Be sure to apply those permissions to all three files.

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ chmod 755 test*

OR

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ chmod a+rw test* && chmod u+rwx test*

 

4. On 'test1', leave the permissions as set in Step #3. On 'test2', using the appropriate elevated access and special attributes for files, set the file so that regardless of ownership, the file cannot be overwritten but CAN be appended to. On 'test3', using the special attributes for files, set the file to be immutable regardless of permissions or ownership.

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ sudo chattr +a test2

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ sudo chattr +i test3

 

5. Before you go further, list the file attributes (not permissions/ownership) and verify the proper attributes are applied as expected. Using the 'echo' command and output redirection, attempt to overwrite the contents each of the three files and note the results.

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ lsattr

(Output)

----i--------e-- ./test3
-------------e-- ./test1
-----a-------e-- ./test2

 (Output)

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ echo "Overwrite" > test1

 

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ echo "Overwrite" > test2

(Output) bash: test2: Operation not permitted

 

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ echo "Overwrite" > test3

(Output) bash: test3: Permission denied

 

6.  Attempt to delete 'test1', 'test2' and 'test3'. If the deletion fails for any of the files, set the appropriate special attribute that will allow the deletion to succeed and verify.

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ rm test1

 

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ rm test2

(Output) rm: cannot remove ‘test2’: Operation not permitted

 

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ rm test3

(Output) rm: remove write-protected regular empty file ‘test3’? y
(Output) rm: cannot remove ‘test3’: Operation not permitted

 

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ sudo chattr -a test2 && sudo chattr -i test3

 

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ rm test2

[user@linuxacademy:attributes/] $ rm test3
