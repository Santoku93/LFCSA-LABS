1. Make sure that your system has Apache Web Server installed. Verify that the server is running, listening for HTTP connections on port 80.

    [root@tcox4 httpd]# telnet localhost 80

    Trying ::1...

    Connected to localhost.

    Escape character is '^]'.

    helo

    501 Not Implemented

    helo to /index.html not supported.

    Connection closed by foreign host.

 

2. Move to the appropriate directory and list the available VHOSTS. Create a new VHOST called "XXX.mylabserver.com" where XXX matches the name of your Linux Academy Lab Server as display in your server tab, add the .conf extension to the end of the file. As part of the name, differentiate the HTTP version of the file so that we can create a separate configuration for HTTPS in a later exercise.

    [root@tcox4 httpd]# cd vhost.d

    [root@tcox4 vhost.d]# ll

    total 8

    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 118 Aug 29 17:22 tcox4.mylabserver.com_http.conf

    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 228 Aug 29 17:44 tcox4.mylabserver.com_https.conf

    [root@tcox4 vhost.d]# cat tcox4.mylabserver.com_http.conf 

3. Edit that configuration file so that is contains the appropriate sections and variables for the site path, error and access logs and the server name and any aliases. Display the contents once completed.

    (NOTE: VirtualHost *:80 Definition)

    ServerName tcox4.mylabserver.com

    ServerAlias tcox4

     

    DocumentRoot /var/www/tcox4

 

4. Create a directory to contain your custom VHOST site files. Once created, add the following HTML code to a file in that directory called 'index.html'

  -XXX.MYLABSERVER.COM

  - Please note: replace 'xxx' above with the name of your Linux Academy Lab Server as indicated in the server tab of the site

    [root@tcox4 httpd]# mkdir /var/www/tcox5

    [root@tcox4 httpd]# echo "XXX.MYLABSERVER.COM" >> /var/www/tcox5/index.html

5. Execute the appropriate command to enable that new VHOST configuration on the site. Restart the web server. Once restarted, browser (by NAME) to the site and verify that the file created in Step #4 is what appears.

    [root@tcox4 httpd]# systemctl restart httpd

    (NOTE: You will have to open a web browser and navigate to the site by NAME to see the new index.html page we created)
